- SIGSTOP/TSTP behaviour: should we stop *after* handlers run ?

- Debug signal delivery with catches on 6809 (not clear this is
  correct right now)

- RAW (char mode) disk I/O gives iffy results on most platforms. As we have
  O_DIRECT we should probably just throw the entire thing out.

- Weird Z80 crash with irq driven wakeup

	psleep(0xD266)wakeup: found proc 0xC46A pid 7
	psleep(0xD266)wakeup: found proc 0xC46A pid 7
	psleep(0xD266)wakeup: found proc 0xC46A pid 7
	psleep(0xD266)wakeup: found proc 0xC46A pid 7
	psleep(0xD266)wakeup: found proc 0xC46A pid 7
	psleep(0xD266)wakeup: found proc 0xC46A pid 7
	psleep(0xD266)psleep(0xD266) -> 0:0
	panic: psleep: voodoo
	System halted, bye.

suggests sleep/wakeup/irq race somewhere still
