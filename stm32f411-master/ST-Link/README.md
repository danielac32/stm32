ST_Link

This is the first work I did with the STM32F11.
I hooked up my ST-Link (note that the pins are backward
compared to the blue pill -- beware!!)

I read out the blink program the board shipped with,
verified that it really did have 512K of flash and
read out the onboard boot loader in system memory.
